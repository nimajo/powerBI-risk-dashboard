Description:
Built an end‑to‑end Cyber/GRC risk dashboard using Power BI and a custom Excel risk register. The project simulates a real organisational risk environment and includes dynamic KPIs, a risk heatmap, owner workload analysis, and interactive filtering.

Key elements include:

Risk density heatmap (Likelihood × Impact)

KPI cards for total risks, high‑risk items (score ≥15), and overdue reviews (DAX using TODAY())

Top risks visualised by score with conditional formatting

Risk owner workload breakdown for operational insight

Fully interactive slicers for owner, risk score, likelihood, impact, and mitigation status

Clean, governance‑focused layout suitable for reporting to senior stakeholders

This project demonstrates practical experience in Power BI, DAX, data modelling, and risk analytics aligned with GRC and cybersecurity practices.
